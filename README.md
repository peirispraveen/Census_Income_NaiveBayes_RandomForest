With the purpose of predicting whether a person's income surpasses $50,000 annually based on a range of demographic and socioeconomic parameters,
we examined the “ UCI Adult Census” dataset in this study. Features including age, marital status, workclass, education, and occupation are included in the dataset.

Preprocessing the data, visualizing its properties, and creating predictive models with “Random Forest” and “Naive Bayes” classifiers were our objectives.
To increase computational efficiency, we also used “Principal Component Analysis” (PCA) to reduce dimensionality.

We assessed the performance of classifiers both before and after PCA.
